## üßê What Does This Program Do?

This interactive Python program simulates the mechanics of a roulette ball spinning on a wheel. By timing the ball‚Äôs rotations, it predicts the segment where the ball will land. It combines real-world physics with coding to create an engaging and rewarding experience. 

### Key Features:
- Simulates the ball's deceleration and stopping position using mathematical calculations.
- Predicts the winning segment on a European roulette table (37 segments).
- Provides an interactive way to learn about coding and probability.

## üöÄ How to Use
- Press "Enter" each time the ball passes zero (3 times in total).
- The program will calculate the ball's deceleration and predict the winning segment.
- The output will display the predicted number where the ball lands.
